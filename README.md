## 🧠 Project Overview

OJAR, a premium perfume brand, wants to improve the efficiency of its digital marketing campaigns. Currently, all customers are treated the same regardless of their behavior — leading to missed opportunities and marketing waste.

This project uses **RFM segmentation** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to identify and classify customer groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. It enables **targeted campaign planning**, increased **ROI**, and better **customer retention**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform **RFM analysis** on customer transaction data
- Create actionable **customer segments**
- Analyze **demographics** (age, gender, country) per segment
- Deliver an interactive **Tableau dashboard** and strategic insights
- Present business recommendations to improve marketing efficiency

## 🗃️ Dataset Summary

| Table Name         | Description                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `Transactions_Data`| Transaction history (date, amount, customer_id)|
| `Customers_Data`   | Customer demographics & profile info           |
| `RFM_Segment_Data` | Final output table with RFM scores and labels  |

- ✅ 438 customers  
- ✅ 7,864 transactions  
- ✅ Fields: Age, Gender, Country, Signup Date, Purchase Behavior

---

## 🧮 RFM Segmentation Logic (SQL)

**Scoring Logic:**
- `Recency`: Days since last purchase (lower = better)
- `Frequency`: Total purchases (higher = better)
- `Monetary`: Total spend (higher = better)

**Segmentation via NTILE Buckets:**
```sql
NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY recency DESC) AS R_score
NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY frequency ASC) AS F_score
NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY monetary ASC) AS M_score
```

**Segment Mapping Rules:**

| Segment         | Rules                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `Champions`| R=5, F=5, M=5 |
| `Loyal Customers`   | R ≥ 4, F ≥ 4 |
| `Big Spenders` | M = 5 |
| `New Customers`| R = 5, F ≤ 2 |
| `At Risk`   | R ≤ 2, F ≥ 4 |
| `Others` | Everyone else |

**Features:**
- KPI Summary (Total Revenue, Avg Recency, Frequency)
- Segment Distribution with % breakdown
- Behavioral Profiling (RFM Averages)
- Demographics: Age Group, Country, Gender
- Fully Filterable Customer Table (with mini bar charts)

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- 💡 Champions and Big Spenders represent <10% of customers but contribute the highest revenue
- 📉 At Risk customers show strong past value but long recency → reactivation priority
- 👥 26–35 age group dominates high-value segments → age-targeted campaigns have high potential
- 🌍 Canada and USA have the highest-value customers
- ⚖️ Gender is balanced → marketing tone can remain neutral

## 📢 Marketing Strategy by Segment
| Segment         | Goal                                    | Action Plan |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `Champions`| Retain/Upsell | VIP previews, loyalty gifts, referral bonuses |
| `Loyal Customers` | Strengthen Loyalty | Tiered perks, surprise incentives |
| `Big Spenders` | Reactivate | Premium re-engagement offers, concierge |
| `At Risk`| Win-back | Feedback surveys, urgency coupons |
| `New Customers`   | Nurture | Welcome series, 2nd-order incentive |
| `Others` | Test Engagement | Discounted bundles, newsletter funneling |
